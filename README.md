# Sorting Visualizer

This project is a visual representation of various sorting algorithms, providing an interactive and educational experience to understand how each algorithm works in real-time.

## Features

- **Interactive UI:** Users can adjust the number of bars to be sorted and the speed of the sorting visualization.
- **Algorithm Selection:** Supports various sorting algorithms including Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort.
- **Responsive Design:** Adjusts to different screen sizes and is visually appealing.

## Live Demo

You can view the live demo of this project [here](https://amazingashish.github.io/SortingVisualizer/).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Handles the styling and responsiveness of the interface.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the sorting algorithms and interactive features.

## Sorting Algorithms

1. **Selection Sort**
2. **Bubble Sort**
3. **Insertion Sort**
4. **Merge Sort**
5. **Quick Sort**
6. **Heap Sort**

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/sorting-visualizer.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser:
   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

## Usage

1. Select the sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
2. Adjust the speed of the sorting using the speed dropdown menu.
3. Use the size slider to set the number of bars to be sorted.
4. Click the "Randomize Array" button to generate a new set of random bars.
5. Press the "Sort" button to visualize the chosen sorting algorithm in action.

## Customization

You can easily modify the number of bars or speed of the visualizer by adjusting the values of the following variables in the `script.js` file:

- `numOfBars`: Defines the number of bars to be sorted.
- `speedFactor`: Controls the speed of the visualization.
